### Project description

This is a project to create a Flask app with python on Heroku in which users enter a stock ticker and then plots the price data for that ticker symbol.

The stock exchange data is obtained from Quandle WIKI dataset<https://www.quandl.com/data/WIKI-Wiki-EOD-Stock-Prices> using Python's Requests library along with json to access it in Python via API.

The data is analyzed using pandas and ploted using Bokeh.

The app is now accessible at https://stockfetcher.herokuapp.com
